  "4.6 Iteration

The macros described here provide more sophisticated, high-level looping constructs to complement Emacs Lisp’s basic loop forms (see Iteration in GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual).")

;; 11.5 Iteration

;; Iteration means executing part of a program repetitively. For;; example, you might want to repeat some computation once for e;; ach element of a list, or once for each integer from 0 to n. ;; You can do this in Emacs Lisp with the special form while:


;; To write a repeat-until loop, which will execute something on;;  each iteration and then do the end-test, put the body follow;; ed by the end-test in a progn as the first argument of while,;;  as shown here:

(while (progn
	 (forward-line 1)
	 (not (looking-at "^$"))))

;; Macro: iter-do (var iterator) body … ¶

;;    Run body with var bound to each value that iterator produces. 

;; The Common Lisp loop facility also contains features for work;; ing with iterators. See Loop Facility in Common Lisp Extensio;; ns.

;; The following piece of code demonstrates some important princ;; iples of working with iterators.

;; Function: object-intervals OBJECT ¶

;;    This function returns a copy of the intervals (i.e., text ;; properties) in object as a list of intervals. object must be ;; a string or a buffer. Altering the structure of this list doe;; s not change the intervals in the object.

"33.19.2 Changing Text Properties

The primitives for changing properties apply to a specified range of text in a buffer or string. The function set-text-properties (see end of section) sets the entire property list of the text in that range; more often, it is useful to add, change, or delete just certain properties specified by name.

Since text properties are considered part of the contents of the buffer (or string), and can affect how a buffer looks on the screen, any change in buffer text properties marks the buffer as modified. Buffer text property changes are undoable also (see Undo). Positions in a string start from 0, whereas positions in a buffer start from 1.")


;; dialog call elements packages

;; Function: put-text-property start end prop value &optional ob;; ject ¶

;;     This function sets the prop property to value for the tex;; t between start and end in the string or buffer object. If ob;; ject is nil, it defaults to the current buffer.

;; 33.19 Text Properties

;; Each character position in a buffer or a string can have a te;; xt property list, much like the property list of a symbol (se;; e Property Lists). The properties belong to a particular char;; acter at a particular place, such as, the letter ‘T’ at the b;; eginning of this sentence or the first ‘o’ in ‘foo’—if the sa;; me character occurs in two different places, the two occurren;; ces in general have different properties.

;; Each property has a name and a value. Both of these can be an;; y Lisp object, but the name is normally a symbol. Typically e;; ach property name symbol is used for a particular purpose; fo;; r instance, the text property face specifies the faces for di;; splaying the character (see Properties with Special Meanings);; . The usual way to access the property list is to specify a n;; ame and ask what value corresponds to it.

;; If a character has a category property, we call it the proper;; ty category of the character. It should be a symbol. The prop;; erties of the symbol serve as defaults for the properties of ;; the character.

;; Copying text between strings and buffers preserves the proper;; ties along with the characters; this includes such diverse fu;; nctions as substring, insert, and buffer-substring.

;; Search for the next region of text whose property prop is a m;; atch for value (which defaults to nil), according to predicat;; e.

;; This function is modeled after search-forward (see Searching ;; for Strings) and friends, in that it moves point, but it also;;  returns a structure that describes the match instead of retu;; rning it in match-beginning and friends.

;; If the text property whose value is a match can’t be found, t;; he function returns nil. If it’s found, point is placed at th;; e end of the region that has this matching text property, and;;  the function returns a prop-match structure with information;;  about the match.

;; predicate can either be t (which is a synonym for equal), nil;;  (which means “not equal”), or a predicate that will be calle;; d with two arguments: value and the value of the text propert;; y prop at the buffer position that is a candidate for a match;; . The function should return non-nil if there’s a match, nil ;; otherwise.

;; If not-current is non-nil, then if point is already in a regi;; on where we have a property match, skip past that region and ;; find the next region instead.

;; The prop-match structure has the following accessor functions;; : prop-match-beginning (the start of the match), prop-match-e;; nd (the end of the match), and prop-match-value (the value of;;  property at the start of the match).

;; In the examples below, we use a buffer whose contents is:

;; This is a bold and here’s bolditalic and this is the end.

;; That is, the “bold” words are the bold face, and the “italic”;;  word is in the italic face.

;; With point at the start:

(setq-default
 mode-line-buffer-identification
 '(:eval (propertize "%12b"
		     'face (if (mode-line-window-selected-p)
			       'bold
			     'italic))))

;; 2.5.4 Frame Type

;; A frame is a screen area that contains one or more Emacs wind;; ows; we also use the term “frame” to refer to the Lisp object;;  that Emacs uses to refer to the screen area.

;; Frames have no read syntax. They print in hash notation, givi;; ng the frame’s title, plus its address in core (useful to ide;; ntify the frame uniquely).

;; 28.12 Swapping Text Between Two Buffers

;; Specialized modes sometimes need to let the user access from ;; the same buffer several vastly different types of text. For e;; xample, you may need to display a summary of the buffer text,;;  in addition to letting the user access the text itself.

;; This could be implemented with multiple buffers (kept in sync;;  when the user edits the text), or with narrowing (see Narrow;; ing). But these alternatives might sometimes become tedious o;; r prohibitively expensive, especially if each type of text re;; quires expensive buffer-global operations in order to provide;;  correct display and editing commands.

;; Emacs provides another facility for such modes: you can quick;; ly swap buffer text between two buffers with buffer-swap-text;; . This function is very fast because it doesn’t move any text;; , it only changes the internal data structures of the buffer ;; object to point to a different chunk of text. Using it, you c;; an pretend that a group of two or more buffers are actually a;;  single virtual buffer that holds the contents of all the ind;; ividual buffers together. 

(bufferp 1)

;;     This creates and returns an indirect buffer named name wh;; ose base buffer is base-buffer. The argument base-buffer may ;; be a live buffer or the name (a string) of an existing buffer;; . If name is the name of an existing buffer, an error is sign;; aled.

;;     If clone is non-nil, then the indirect buffer originally ;; shares the state of base-buffer such as major mode, minor mod;; es, buffer local variables and so on. If clone is omitted or ;; nil the indirect buffer’s state is set to the default state f;; or new buffers.

;;     If base-buffer is an indirect buffer, its base buffer is ;; used as the base for the new buffer. If, in addition, clone i;; s non-nil, the initial state is copied from the actual base b;; uffer, not from base-buffer.

;;     See Creating Buffers, for the meaning of inhibit-buffer-h;; ooks.
