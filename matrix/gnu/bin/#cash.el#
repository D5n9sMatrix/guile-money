;;    This function creates and returns a new indirect buffer th;; at shares the current buffer’s base buffer and copies the res;; t of the current buffer’s attributes. (If the current buffer ;; is not indirect, it is used as the base buffer.)

;; If display-flag is non-nil, as it always is in interactive ca;; lls, that means to display the new buffer by calling pop-to-b;; uffer. If norecord is non-nil, that means not to put the new ;; buffer to the front of the buffer list.
